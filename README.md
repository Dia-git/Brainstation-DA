"Sleep Data Analysis: From Raw Data to Insights‚Äã: A Data-Driven Investigation into Sleep Health‚Äã"

As I have an educational background in biology and bioinformatics and my professional goal is to transition to a health data analyst role, I picked for the project a set of health data that at this time ignited my curiosity, related to the quality of our sleep.  

I then followed the Process Framework learned during the BrainStation‚Äôs Data Analytics classes: Questions -> Collection -> Explore -> Conclusions -> Communicate 

<img width="530" height="176" alt="Data Framework" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0961674d-01c5-45e1-ac34-97fceafa34a6" />

## Project Overview

## Problem Definition 
Research Context - The Big Picture: Why Sleep Matters‚Äã 

From _"The Global Problem of Insufficient Sleep and Its Serious Public Health Implications"_ [Healthcare, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6473877/)
- Sleep quality is essential for physical and mental health
- Insufficient sleep is a prevalent issue in modern society
- Medical professionals need to understand common sleep disruptors 

## Data Collection
### Data Source: 
- The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv" file, containing detailed information about a number of individuals.
    - Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle - [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data)
- Format: CSV file 
- Size: 375 rows (individual records) √ó 13 columns (metrics)‚Äã
- Type: _Synthetic data created for **illustrative** purposes_ :exclamation:
- ***Disclaimer:***
   - _While I initially intended to work with real-world data and plan to repeat this process using authentic datasets in the future, I discovered late in the project that the dataset used, includes a note indicating that it is synthetic data created by the uploader for illustrative purposes. Nonetheless, given that this dataset has been previously utilized in other analyses and has received positive feedback for its structure and usability, I chose to proceed with it for demonstration purposes. Please note that, although the analytical process and methodology remain valid and replicable, any insights, trends, or correlations derived from this dataset **should not** be interpreted as factual or representative of real-world phenomena._

### Key Features:
1. Sleep Metrics :waning_crescent_moon::zzz:
- Sleep duration (hours per day)‚Äã‚Äã 
- Sleep quality (subjective rating, scale: 1-10)‚Äã 
- Sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea) 

2. Health Indicators  :sparkling_heart:
- Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)‚Äã 
- Heart rate (bpm)‚Äã‚Äã
- BMI category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight)‚Äã 

3. Lifestyle Factors :walking:
- Physical activity levels (minutes/day)
- Stress levels (subjective rating, scale: 1-10)‚Äã 
- Daily steps

4. Identifiers üë•
   - Person ID‚Äã
   - Gender ‚Äã(Male/Female)‚Äã
   - Age (years)‚Äã
   - Occupation‚Äã 

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, the following cleaning steps were performed in Excel:

 - BMI Category Standardization
     - Corrected inconsistencies between "Normal" and "Normal Weight"
     - Used 'Split Text to Columns' action (+ Delete)


  <img width="314" height="149" alt="Excel - Data cleaning BMI Categories" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a60aa3dd-5168-4d0b-b8f6-a33225c66734" />

 - Blood Pressure Processing 
     - Split BP text string into two numerical columns:  
             - Systolic Blood Pressure
             - Diastolic Blood Pressure
     - Used LEFT() and RIGHT() functions for separation
     - Changed the newly created columns into numerical format rather than text string 


```Excel

-- General Formulas:

=LEFT(text, [length])
=RIGHT(text, [length])


-- Extract Systolic Blood Pressure from Blood Pressure column 
-- Apply formula to extract first 3 numbers from the left end of the original string

=LEFT([@Blood_Pressure], 3)


-- Extract Diastolic Blood Pressure from Blood Pressure column 
-- Apply formula to extract last 2 numbers from the right end of the original string 

=RIGHT([@Blood_Pressure], 2)

```

- Saved Cleaned and Prepared  _"Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv"_ file as:
           ***"Sleep_dataset_SQL.csv"***  - [See file here](

  
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
The EDA involved exploring the sleep health & lifestyle data to answer some key research questions, such as: 

### :question: **Primary/Main Question:**
_What health and lifestyle metrics may influence sleep quality/duration or vice versa?_

### :arrow_right: **Project Goal**
_Test the hypothesis that sleep quality and duration positively correlate with a healthy lifestyle._

### :grey_question: **Secondary Questions:**
1. Gender Differences ‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è
 - _Is there a difference between genders in terms of sleep quality?_
 - _Is there a difference between genders in terms of sleep duration?_

2. Physical Activity Impact üí™
 - _Do people with higher physical activity levels experience better sleep quality?_
 - _Is there a relationship between daily steps and sleep duration?_

3. Occupation & Stress Effects ü§Ø
 - _Do people with higher stress levels sleep more or less?_
 - _Is there a correlation between occupation, stress levels and sleep quality?_

4. Health Indicators ü©∫
 - _How do blood pressure levels correlate with sleep patterns?_
 - _Is there a relationship between BMI category and sleep disorders?_
    

## Initial Data Analysis in Excel

1. Age Group Classification

```Excel

-- Apply formula to group individuals in age groups:
-- Total age range: 27-59 years‚Äã

=IF([@Age]<37, "Group 1: 27-36", IF([@Age]<47, "Group 2: 37-46", "Group 3: 47-59"))
```

- Created three age groups: ‚Äã 

   - Group 1: Late 20's to mid-30's (27-36)‚Äã 
   - Group 2: Late 30's to mid-40's (37-46)‚Äã 
   - Group 3: Late 40's to late-50's (47-59)‚Äã


2. PivotTable Analysis

  - The pivot table shows that the data is a bit unbalanced in terms of count of distinctive age for each of the three groups, with the middle one (37 to 46) having more individuals (158) compared to  the other 2(106 and 110).
  - The sleep duration is not very different for all groups on average, with a slight increase with the age increase. The same increase can be noticed for average quality of sleep but to a slightly higher degree.
  - Physical Activity levels are rather different with the older group (47- 59) being slightly more active on average.

 - Inspecting Data in SQL:

```sql
-- Gender Distribution:
SELECT COUNT(PersonID), Gender
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
GROUP BY Gender;
```

<img width="168" height="72" alt="Group by gender Outcome" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f74e0b95-2820-473b-9693-c6163a4fe4ce" />

```sql

-- Age Distribution by Gender

SELECT AVG(Age), Gender
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
GROUP BY Gender;


-- Stress Levels by Gender

SELECT AVG(Stress_Level), Gender
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
GROUP BY Gender;


-- Multiple Health Metrics by Gender

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT BMI_Category),
    AVG(Systolic_BP),
    AVG(Diastolic_BP),
    AVG(Daily_Steps),
    AVG(Physical_Activity_Level),
    Gender
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
GROUP BY Gender; 
```


- EDA Observations:

   1. There‚Äôs a difference in age averages between male and female which can create biases in the data analysis results: 37.0741 (Male) vs 47.4054 (Female)

<img width="156" height="71" alt="Average age by gender - SQL EDA Outcome" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be3a32ae-0f65-4fad-aacd-a1ff22de911e" />

        
   3. The males in our sample are on average more stressed than the females: 6.0794 (Male) vs 4.6757 (Female)
        
   4. For other measures the data is more balanced: 

  <img width="522" height="98" alt="Health Metrics EDA in MySQl" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f34fc6-0ad4-41e3-b043-d4f2aa94acb1" />

      
```sql
-- Blood Pressure Analysis --

-- Q: How many people in the sample have high and very high blood presure? 
-- A: Calculate Total Number of High Blood Pressure Cases (Stage 1+)
-- Stage 1 HBP: 130-139 mmHg/80-89 mmHg
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
WHERE ((Diastolic_BP > 80) OR (Systolic_BP > 130));

-- Q: How many people in the sample have very high blood presure?
-- A: Calculate Total Number of Very High Blood Pressure Cases (Stage 2)
-- Stage 2 HBP: 140/90 mmHg or higher
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
WHERE ((Diastolic_BP > 90) OR (Systolic_BP > 140));

-- Looking at High Blood Pressure Cases by Gender
SELECT COUNT(*), Gender
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
WHERE ((Diastolic_BP > 80) OR (Systolic_BP > 130))
GROUP BY Gender;

-- Looking at Very High Blood Pressure Cases by Gender
SELECT COUNT(*), Gender
FROM sleep_database.sleep_dataset_sql 
WHERE ((Diastolic_BP > 90) OR (Systolic_BP > 140)) 
GROUP BY Gender; 
```

- EDA Observations:
  
1. Blood Pressure Distribution ‚ÄãResults: 
      - High BP (Stage 1+): 221 individuals total (Males: 108 cases‚Äã vs Females: 113 cases‚Äã)
      - Very High BP (Stage 2): 69 individuals total ‚Äã(Males: 4 cases‚Äã vs Females: 65 cases‚Äã)


‚Äã2. Notable Data Quality Concern: Significant gender disparity in Stage 2 hypertension cases (Blood Pressure Distribution)‚Äã

   - Disproportionate number of females with stage 2 hypertension‚Äã
   - Potential sampling bias: 94% of Stage 2 cases are female‚Äã
   - May require additional validation or data collection

<img width="354" height="203" alt="Avg  Sleep Duration by Gender" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e730e1a-35be-4731-a1eb-ef4edf2ff355" />
 

## Limitations

Drawing Conclusions: 
Rich dataset with potential insights for Sleep Metrics:‚Äã

The data analysis shows that sleep quality and duration is positively
correlate with the physical activity levels of the individuals in our
sample;‚Äã

Sleep duration decreases as stress levels increase;‚Äã

Choice of occupation and BMI category may affect the sleep
metrics.‚Äã

Based on the data, the hypothesis that sleep quality and duration are
positively correlate with healthy lifestyle (low stress, normal BMI,
high PAL) is proven correct. ‚Äã

However, no clear pattern was seen between daily step count and
sleep metrics. ‚Äã

More balanced data is needed to find statistically significant insights. ‚Äã

‚Äã
Data Quality Alert‚Äã‚Äã

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Biases:‚Äã‚Äã

Age gap between genders‚Äã‚Äã

Uneven BP distribution‚Äã‚Äã

Uneven Distinct Age Counts‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚Äã

Recommendations for Further
Analysis:‚Äã‚Äã

Consider a larger population sample
that is closer to a normal
distribution in terms of age ‚Äã‚Äã

Validate blood pressure
distributions against population
norms‚Äã
