BrainStation Data Analytics Certification Portfolio: This repository highlights my work from the BrainStation Data Analyst Certification (DAC™), an intensive 8-week program (Sep–Nov 2024) focused on the complete data analytics workflow: from problem formulation and data cleaning to visualization and insight presentation.


Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience working with real-world datasets across multiple domains, developing both technical and analytical skills required to extract meaningful insights and communicate them effectively to diverse audiences.

Skills & Tools Developed
- Advanced Excel – Exploratory data analysis, complex formulas, and advanced cleaning techniques
- SQL – Data extraction, schema design, query optimization, and relational database management
- Tableau – Designing interactive dashboards, applying visualization best practices, and data storytelling

Capstone Project: Sleep Health Analysis
The capstone project demonstrates the integration of all skills acquired during the program:
 - Objective: Investigate sleep health patterns and their correlation with lifestyle and health factors.
 - Approach:
    --> Leveraged SQL for efficient extraction and transformation of raw health metrics
    --> Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis in Excel to uncover trends and anomalies
    --> Designed interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize sleep quality, duration, and associations with lifestyle variables
 - Outcome: Delivered a clear, data-driven narrative on how various factors—such as physical activity, stress, and work patterns—affect sleep quality. The analysis highlights opportunities for improving overall health outcomes through better sleep habits.
